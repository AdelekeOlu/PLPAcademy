# **Fun Calculator** 🎲➕➖✖️➗  

A simple yet powerful Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers. Perfect for quick calculations with a fun twist!  

---

## **Features** ✨  
- **Addition** ➕: Adds two numbers (positive vibes only!)  
- **Subtraction** ➖: Finds the difference (negative vibes, but necessary!)  
- **Multiplication** ✖️: Multiplies for more bang for your buck!  
- **Division** ➗: Divides the first number by the second (no math disasters, please!)  

---

## **How to Use** 🚀  
1. **Run the script** in your Python environment:  
   ```sh
   python fun_calculator.py
   ```
2. **Enter the first number** when prompted.  
3. **Enter the second number** when prompted.  
4. **See the results!** The calculator will display:  
   - Sum  
   - Difference  
   - Product  
   - Quotient  

### **Example Output** 📊  
```
Enter the first number: 10  
Enter the second number: 2  
Results of your two numbers:  
Sum: 12.0  
Difference: 8.0  
Product: 20.0  
Quotient: 5.0  
```

## **Requirements** 🔧  
- **Python 3.x**  

---

## **Limitations & Notes** ⚠️  
- **Division by zero** will crash the program (for now—handle with care!).  
- Supports **decimal numbers** (thanks to `float()`).  
- Basic operations only—no fancy trigonometry here (yet!).  

---

## **Future Improvements** 🔮  
- [ ] Add error handling for division by zero.  
- [ ] Support more operations (exponents, modulus, etc.).  
- [ ] Allow multiple calculations in one session.
